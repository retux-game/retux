HOW TO RUN

If you have downloaded a version of the game designated for a particular
system, simply run the executable.

To run the source code, you will need Python 3.6 or later
<https://www.python.org>. You will also need the dependencies listed in
requirements.txt, which you can install automatically by using the
following command:

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the game by
running "retux.py". On most systems, this should be done by
double-clicking on it; if you are shown a dialog asking you if you want
to display or run the file, choose to run it.

There are some command-line options that can be passed. Run the game in
a terminal with the "-h" command-line option for more information.
